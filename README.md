# voice-agent-test
Hello! This project aims to create typescript/javacript interfaces for voice interaction (STT and TTS).
Currently the primary focus is on speech recognition, with an interface called `RecognitionService` acting as the blueprint for implementations.
There are already a few implementations of this interface created with varying levels of functionality.

Check the examples folder for demos of how to use the interface/implementations.


The best way to learn the api of `RecognitonService` is to look at it's source code in [`lib/src/recognitionService/interface.ts`](lib/src/recognitionService/interface.ts)
